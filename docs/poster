Okay... believe it or not, here it finally is.  Several people who have been
mailing me for months to ask about the status of 3.0 graciously
"volunteered" to beta-test, and all appears to work.

Ytalk is in essence a multi-user replacement for the UNIX "talk" program.
Not only will ytalk allow any number of users to connect with one another,
but it also will communicate with _both_ UNIX talk daemons, as well as
daemons compiled incorrectly and/or with byte-order or address boundary
problems.

There is a very large ytalk following spanning every continent, and older
versions of ytalk are available on more anonymous FTP sites than I can even
keep track of, but this is the first time I have attempted to post the
sources to a newsgroup.  Somehow, this seems more organized (or maybe I'm
frightfully naive... :-)

Version 3.0 is also the first ytalk source I am actually proud of.  It has
been completely rewritten since 2.3 to remove all of the desperate hacks
placed in response to incoming bug reports and comments.

My development platform is a Sun SPARC.  Although I have tested on every
platform I have access to, I am always looking for cross-platform compile
problems should anyone wish to mail me some.

	As always, have fun.
