				YTalk

YTalk is a compatible replacement for the Unix talk(1) program, which
adds a number of features.  Mainly, it can talk to more than one person
at a time, and it can the two different types of talk daemons out there.

For compilation and installation instructions, please see the file
`INSTALL' in the same directory.  The gist of it is:

	./configure
	make
	make install

YTalk is free software, which can be freely redistributed, used and
modified as long as the copyright notices are kept in the source and
header files.

If you hack in new neat things, or fix bugs, or have ideas about new
features, feel free to mail me at <ytalk@impul.se> about
it.  Same if you have trouble compiling or running YTalk.
