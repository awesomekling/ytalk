[ the following code fails under ytalk's shell but not in other
  places.  weird.  ]

See the screenshot below.  As you can see, the problem is
intermittent.  I can't run `strace' to see what's going wrong, because
ytalk breaks that too.

The code in dpkg that's failing amounts to
  c= fork();  if (c<0) bomb_out();
  if (!c) { exec(); bomb_out(); }
  repeatedly { rc= waitpid(c,&status); error_check(); }
and it's the waitpid that's failing with ECHILD.

RUBDEF and languages:  0xfd is used by some language encodings, but
YTalk uses it to recognize itself... need to figure something out.
