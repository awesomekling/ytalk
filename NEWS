from 3.1 to 3.1.1
  . try to look for the current machine's fqdn if hostname() doens't
    include a '.'
  . fixed the shell under Solaris (oops, broke it in 3.1!)
  . misc autoconf fixes
  . resizing didn't work with Linux and ncurses, fixed it
  . YTalk now checks that connections are answered form the expected host;
    if they aren't, it complains and shows the new hostname
  . n-way talk sessions should now be free of duplicated users
  . fixed the "readdress" option somewhat
  . portability fixes for 64-bit machines (size_t instead of int)


from 3.1beta2 to 3.1
  . minor documentation updates

from 3.1beta1 to 3.1beta2:
  . config.h.in was missing a line for HAVE_IOVEC_H
  . redid the test for termios vs sgtty, making sure tcgetattr exists if
    termios is to be selected
  . fixed 8bit-cleanness

from 3.0pl2 to 3.1beta1: 
  (this includes things that went into the various 3.0.3-8bit versions)
  . fixed line wrap inside shells (at the cost of breaking the specs in
    term.doc slightly)
  . made ESC[r in shells
  . added the /dev/ptmx style of pty's, and some Solaris-specific code to
    go with it
  . added -Y to ask for caps in yes/no questions
  . added -i to leave the incoming talks to the daemon
  . added the 'k' option to the main menu (kill all unconnected)
  . avoid clearing the window when the last partner ^C's on you
  . 8 bit clean (except for character 0xfe, which is the lower case
    Icelandic thorn, b/c that is used as the delete char in ytalk, for
    some reason)
  . always undesrtood both ^h and delete (^?) as delete chars
  . fixed annoying bug with UDP handling under Linux (that's where the
    spurious "no talk daemon" messages were coming from!)
  . made ytalk send out fqdn's when passing users around, so the other
    machine has a chance to resolve the address
  . use strerror() instead of sys_errlist, where available
  . redefine our own sockaddr_in, since BSD4.4 (and FreeBSD and friends)
    use a different definition from what the talk daemons expect
  . split the "auto-rering" flag into "rering" and "prompt-rering"
  . added aliases for whole addresses, hostnames and login names
  . ported to GNU Autoconf
  . let the user save his own side of the conversation too
  . support virtual hosts and multihomed machines, by letting the user pick
    which interface to use, and otherwise making a guess at it
