TODO before YTalk 4 can be released:
====================================

* Wide character support (HELP, please!)

* sizeof(yachar) is 12 bytes. This is beyond ridiculous.

* User viewports clear when resizing one vertical unit.

* Changing scrollback buffer size and then reloading config -> craziness.

* There is a bug with YTK when the talkd isn't up at first call.

* There's been a few requests for more color names, such as "gray"

* Write a new manpage

* Create a new website with:
  - screenshots (the easy part)
  - online documentation (well, something)
