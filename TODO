TODO before YTalk 4 can be released:
====================================

* Wide character support (HELP, please!)

* sizeof(yachar) is 6 bytes. This is ridiculous.

* Make some silly snprintf() wrapper for sprintf() so we can get rid
  of all the #ifdef HAVE_SNPRINTF crap.

* Changing scrollback buffer size and then reloading config -> craziness.

* There is a bug with YTK when the talkd isn't up at first call.

* There's been a few requests for more color names, such as "gray"
